# Stay Safe
This is a repository for CS476 course project

Project Summary
People feel danger to visit public spaces due to possibility of infection, but still needs to visit some public spaces for important purposes. Therefore, we create a safety reviewing system for public spaces to acknowledge users of its safety. Safety of public spaces are crowdsourced by reviews, and reviews themselves are quality controlled by other users.

Instruction
1. Add Reviews by pressing '+' button
